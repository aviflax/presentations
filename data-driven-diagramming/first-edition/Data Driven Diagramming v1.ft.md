# Data Driven Diagramming v1

## Intro

### slide

Today I’d like to share some thoughts on something that may seem prosaic, maybe even mundane.

And maybe it is mundane, but it’s something I care about deeply. So I’m going to try to convince you that maybe you should care a little bit too.

## What Is

### slide

[various diagrams]

Diagrams are a powerful and widely used medium for teaching and learning about software systems.

They’re so commonplace that many of us rarely stop to think about how they are created and maintained.

Well, I’ve been creating and maintaining diagrams like these for decades.

Over time, I started asking myself: why am I always, inevitably, drawn towards diagrams and diagramming?

Every time I start a new job, or switch teams, I invariably look for diagrams that can help me learn about my new context — and often I don’t find any, so I create them myself.

What’s going on here?

## Interlude

[blank, or maybe a blurry diagram]

This was puzzling to me for a long time, because I don’t think of myself as a visual person.

In fact, let me tell you a story.

### slide

[screenshot of Ruby’s tweet]

In April 2016, I was scrolling through my Twitter timeline when I came across this tweet by Sam Ruby (who’s currently the president of Apache) which linked to a tweet by Blake Ross, one of the creators of Firefox.

Blake’s tweet linked to this essay he’d just written.
I followed the link and started reading, and I was astounded.

And that’s how I found out that I have aphantasia — an impaired ability to visualize in my “mind’s eye”

### slide

[??]

Suddenly, lots of random idiosyncrasies, tics and quirks of mine fit together, made sense, had a unifying narrative.
In particular, I now, for the first time, had a plausible hypothesis for the quirks of my memory; specifically, how my memory works — or doesn’t.

### slide

[??]

We don’t have time for a comprehensive discussion of how my memory works, but one aspect that’s relevant is that I’m almost completely unable to memorize.

It’s not that I’m unable to learn new information, and not that I’m unable to access information I’ve previously learned.

It’s almost as though I’m just missing certain kinds of indices that other people have. If our memories are data structures, then most people’s seem to be extremely sophisticated structures allowing for random access and multiple indices on the same data.

Whereas my memory seems to be just a simple tree; the only way to get to a given node is to walk the tree.

The end-result is that I don’t know how to memorize anything intentionally; I see memorization as a kind of brute-force technique that is just incompatible with my wetware. Instead, the only way for me to retain anything usefully is to really learn it. To learn it as a system, as a network of connected information, a Web, etc.

The thing is, for me to really learn something takes time — often a lot of time.

### slide

[???]

In a world that often equates memory with intelligence, I have developed habits and strategies to compensate for my inability to memorize — for example, I rely heavily on reference materials while writing programs.

### slide

[screenshot of Dash]

For example, this is Dash, one of my favorite programming tools. It downloads and indexes API docs, for…

I’ve come to believe that I use diagrams similarly to these API docs — as a reference, as a sort of an external memory or external index for the systems I need to work with.

There’s another kind of visualization that should be familiar to most of you — a visualization that people often use to get their bearings in a new context, and to learn about that context.

### slide

[map or maps]

When a person enters a new geographical environment, they’ll often refer to maps to get their bearings in that environment and to navigate that environment, until they’ve eventually committed the geographical information they need regularly to memory.

I believe that, for me, a diagram of a system is a way for me to get my bearings in that system, so I can get right to work and be effective before I’ve committed the layout to memory.

Because I can and will eventually commit structures like these to memory — somehow, I learn them, and I can recall the relationships. Not visually, but semantically.
